# LP Productions

## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to improve the overall look and user interactivity to the existing LP Productions website. The gallery was modified into a simple lightbox instead of the previous rotating gallery that moved the home page up and down while scrolling. A contact form was added to make it easier to see what potential clients may need. One last change was the removal of several social networking icons. The company rarely makes updates on anything other than Twitter and Facebook so all other icons were removed. Additional content still needs to be added to the services and about pages.

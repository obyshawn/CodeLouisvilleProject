# LP Productions

## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to improve the overall look and user interactivity to the existing LP Productions website. The gallery was modified into a simple lightbox instead of the previous rotating gallery that moved the home page up and down while scrolling. A contact form with email data validation was created to make it simpler for potential clients to focus on their specific needs. One last change to the existing website was the removal of several social networking icons. The company rarely updates anything other than Twitter and Facebook so all other icons were removed.

Additional content will be added to the "services" and "about" pages once all that information is available.
